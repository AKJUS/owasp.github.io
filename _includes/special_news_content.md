This month, we are featuring <a href="https://root.io/">root.io</a>, a Platinum Corporate Supporter of OWASP, which specializes in automated container remediation. In this interview, we discuss the origins of root.io, root's use of OWASP materials and our impact on their operations, how they use software bill of materials with OWASP CycloneDX, and how you can get your project startup idea off the ground and some advice for future OWASP project entrepreneurs. 

A huge thank you to all our Corporate Supporters! We will be featuring more corporate supporter stories in the coming months, so stay tuned!
