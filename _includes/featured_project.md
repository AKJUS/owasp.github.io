AI applications are on the rise and so are the concerns regarding AI security and privacy. How can AI systems be attacked? How can they be protected?
This is why OWASP is now offering the [AI security & privacy guide](/www-project-ai-security-and-privacy-guide/#) - to provide clear and actionable insights on designing, creating, testing, and procuring secure and privacy-preserving AI systems. By open-sourcing our understanding of the state-of-the-art, we can create consensus and collect ideas from a variety of perspectives.
