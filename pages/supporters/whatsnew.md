- OWASP Member early-bird registration discounts for all your staff, even if they aren't a member
- A trademark license agreement allows Corporate Members to use OWASP's brand with their marketing,  products, and services.
- Regional pricing is available for all packages.
- Startup pricing is open to all companies less than 36 months old.

## What's changing for the better

We understand that COVID has impacted everyone. Package pricing based upon your organization's gross income is going away, as this held back many sponsors both before and during the pandemic. 

## Opt in upgrades for existing members

As no part of your existing Corporate Membership package is being removed, OWASP will migrate all current sponsors to the new Corporate Sponsorship packages at your request. The new packages provide immediate access to all additional benefits for the residual term of your Corporate Sponsorship at the level you paid.

You don't need to do anything today. We will be communicating with you individually over the next month to discuss setting up your new benefits, such as sending you your Corporate Sponsor badge and executing a trademark license agreement. Accessing the new benefits is entirely optional. However, if you decide to take on the OWASP trademark license agreement, for example, there is an additional agreement to be reviewed and signed.
