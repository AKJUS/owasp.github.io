### What are Regional Corporate Members?

One of OWASP's core values, which drives our mission, is "anyone around the world is encouraged to participate in the OWASP community." However, the financial burden of standard Corporate Membership pricing in countries with emerging or developing economies is very high, so much so that it's nearly impossible for many to afford OWASP Corporate Membership. OWASP offers affordable Regional Corporate Memberships to companies headquartered in emerging and developing economies.

Any organization headquartered in an emerging market or developing country, as defined by the [IMF World Economic Outlook, table E](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2021/03/23/world-economic-outlook-april-2021), that is not a low tax country (defined as a corporate tax rate of less than 15%) is eligible for regional pricing. This is to avoid abuse from organizations registered in known tax havens, who have few staff there and do not operate from there. Due to deliberately opaque transparency laws, it's nearly impossible for OWASP to verify if any organization in such a country is legitimately providing local services. Such tax arrangements, whilst still legal in a few countries, do not align with OWASP's core values of openness, transparency, and integrity.

If an organization is legitimately headquartered in a low tax country, with majority of its staff employed in that country who then provide services to local businesses or individuals, the OWASP Foundation may at its sole discretion grant Regional Corporate Membership after obtaining additional information.

### What are Startup Corporate Members?

Startups founded for less than 24 months at time of joining or renewal are eligible to access the Corporate Membership Startup discount. Evidence such as a company registration record will be required.
