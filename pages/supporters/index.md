## 20th Anniversary Celebrations!

We have completely refreshed our Corporate Membership program to celebrate our anniversary with some exciting new benefits and options. Here's how you can get involved.

As OWASP's 20th Anniversary approaches on September 24, we will be running a Corporate Membership drive, in the lead up to our [20th Anniversary Celebrations on September 24](https://20thanniversary.owasp.org/).
