First things first - you don't have to do anything. Depending on your current Corporate Supporter package level, you will automatically receive any technical improvements, such as more frequent logo display and a more prominent listing on the supporters page. We have carefully designed our improved packages to continue delivering your existing benefits or improve on them.

## I want these new benefits, what do I do?

Simply [contact us](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/7/group/18/create/72) with your request, and someone will get back to you within three business days.

### Sponsoring participating AppSec Days regional events

This benefit is immediately available for participating in AppSec Days conferences. Please create a non-funding ticket detailing which regional AppSec Day event you wish to sponsor. We will work with you and the local event team to become a financial sponsor of their event.
