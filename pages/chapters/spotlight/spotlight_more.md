[Join us](https://whova.com/web/GKSmlhCK%2FWzBY2c8qqJ%2Bp7kNcnjsUQAQJ%2ByBsjLrbOo%3D/) virtually June 6-10, 2022, for leading application security technologies, speakers, prospects, and community, in a unique event that will build on everything you already know to expect from an OWASP Global Conference.  

[Exhibit and Sponsorship Opportunities](https://dublin.globalappsec.org/assets/files/Virtual_AppSec_EU_2022_Sponsorship_Opportunities.pdf) <br><br>

Designed for private and public sector infosec professionals, the two day OWASP conferences equip developers, defenders, and advocates to build a more 
secure web.  We are offering educational 1-day, 2-day, and 3-day training courses on June 6-8.
