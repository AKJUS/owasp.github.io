The rise of JavaScript and mobile applications have sparked an explosion of easily-accessible REST APIs. But does the rise of APIs result in the downfall of security? Why are there so many vulnerabilities and incidents involving APIs? How can you ensure that your APIs are secure?</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>In this session, we use real-world cases to dive into best practices for securing your APIs. We discuss the attack surface of an API, common authorization problems, and best practice techniques to avoid these problems.

When done correctly, combining secure defaults and lightweight checks can enable organizations to solve *classes* of vulnerabilities by construction, preventing bug whack-a-mole.</p> <p>In this talk, we\u2019ll present a practical step-by-step methodology for:<br/>Choosing what to focus your AppSec resources on<br/>How to combine secure defaults + lightweight invariant enforcement to eradicate entire vulnerability classes<br/>How to integrate continuous code scanning into your CI/CD processes in a way that\u2019s fast, high signal, and low friction for developers<br/>How to use an open source, lightweight security linting tool to find bugs and anti-patterns specific to your company</p> <p>### Bio###<br/>Clint Gibler (@clintgibler) is the Head of Security Research for r2c, a startup working on giving security tools directly to developers.

Increasingly complex, exciting and rich, features are standardized by W3C and implemented in web browsers on a normal basis. New browser features introduce interesting privacy challenges for standardization, research and development. I will demonstrate a privacy case study based on the example of Ambient Light Sensor. A web privacy impact assessment of a planned web browser feature, the Ambient Light Sensor API, indicated risks arising from the exposure of overly precise information about the lighting conditions in the user environment. The analysis led to the demonstration of direct risks of leaks of user data, such as the list of visited websites or exfiltration of sensitive content across distinct browser contexts. Our work contributed to the creation of web standards leading to decisions by browser vendors (i.e. obsolescence, non-implementation or modification to the operation of browser features). We highlight the need to consider broad risks when making reviews of new features. I will suggest practically-driven high-level observations lying on the intersection of web security and privacy risk engineering and modeling, and standardization.</p> <p>Dr Lukasz Olejnik acts as an independent security and privacy researcher and advisor.

The complexity, flexibility and rapid development cycle of Kubernetes mean that Kubernetes security landscape varies significantly across deployments and is not well understood generally.</p> <p>This talk focuses on security of managed cloud Kubernetes clusters, which provide a decently secure baseline that addresses the majority of recommendations you\u2019ll find on the Internet. You\u2019ll come out equipped with understanding of the Kubernetes threat model and actionable recommendations for securely running workloads in Kubernetes.</p> <p>Speaker Bio<br/>Amiran is currently Director, Security and Risk Management at Tasktop, building a product security program. With over 15 years in information security in roles ranging from system engineering and security operations to governance, risk and compliance, Amiran is advocating a pragmatic, business-focused approach to security.<br/>Security is not just a job, it\u2019s a passion.</p> <p>Official Event Sponsor: KPMG Canada (<a href=\"https://home.kpmg/ca/en/home.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://home.kpmg/ca/en/home.html</a>)</p> "}]
