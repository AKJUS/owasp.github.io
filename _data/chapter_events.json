The rise of JavaScript and mobile applications have sparked an explosion of easily-accessible REST APIs. But does the rise of APIs result in the downfall of security? Why are there so many vulnerabilities and incidents involving APIs? How can you ensure that your APIs are secure?</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>In this session, we use real-world cases to dive into best practices for securing your APIs. We discuss the attack surface of an API, common authorization problems, and best practice techniques to avoid these problems. At the end of this session, you will have an actionable set of guidelines to assess and improve the security of your own APIs.</p> <p>Name and title</p> <p>Dr. Philippe De Ryck</p> <p>Web Security Expert, Founder of Pragmatic Web Security</p> <p>Bio</p> <p>Philippe De Ryck helps developers protect companies through better web security.

Keep reading to learn more...</p> <p>THE TALKS</p> <p>TALK 1 : DISCOUNT PHISH BURN BETTER</p> <p>- Did my e-mail provider detect my malicious intent?</p> <p>- Was there an e-mail gateway that saw my malware?</p> <p>- Did it land in the junk/spam folder?</p> <p>- Has the victim even seen it or read it yet?</p> <p>- Did he/she click the link or did it seem suspicious?</p> <p>- Did the malware download properly?</p> <p>- Was it analysed in a sandbox?</p> <p>- Did the Anti-Virus detect it? What about EDR?</p> <p>- Maybe the SOC is torturing my malware in a lab environment right now?</p> <p>- Maybe it executed fine, but just stopped working due to a bug?</p> <p>- Was the outbound C2 traffic blocked or even worse, detected?</p> <p>Have you ever asked yourself one of the above questions, or just wonder how life is as an attacker seeking to conduct a successful (spear) phishing campaign? \"Discount Phish Burn Better\" is a talk about how an attacker can improve his odds of successfully phishing a victim by reducing the cost of payload/malware development.</p> <p>TALK 2 : USER MODE API HOOKS AND BYPASSES</p> <p>- Can I upload my tools to the compromised workstation without being detected or do I have to stay in-memory?</p> <p>- Will the EDR detect if I use process injection to migrate to e.g. explorer.exe?</p> <p>- Can I dump LSASS and steal NTLM hashes?</p> <p>- Can I backdoor an application, e.g. Citrix Receiver to escalate privileges when another user logs in?</p> <p>\u00a0<br/>On-host security products such as Anti-Virus (AV) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) products aim to have sufficient surveillance of the host to ensure that attackers can't operate without being detected. One of the techniques such products use is known as Win32 API hooking in user mode. However, as the user-mode component of APIs are loaded and owned by the current process, the process itself can inspect, overwrite or simply just not use them and use its own implementation of the API functionality, to avoid messing with the hooks altogether. This talk will give an introduction to Win32 APIs, modules, API hooks and different bypass techniques that may be essential to avoiding detection.</p> <p>WHO CAN PARTICIPATE?<br/>The event is open for everyone - but it is highly technical.</p> <p>Photo: Blake Connally, Unsplash.com</p> "}, {"chapter": "Copenhagen", "repo": "www-chapter-copenhagen", "name": "Workshop: Elastic SIEM (4 hr) ", "date": "2021-03-20", "time": "12:00", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Copenhagen-Chapter/events/276244555/", "timezone": "Europe/Copenhagen", "description": "<p>This time around OWASP Copenhagen will host a free 4hr workshop on Elastic SIEM courtesy of David Thejl-Clayton - SOC leader of JN Data.</p> <p>The workshop is designed to get you started using it and provide you with hands-on experience with that along with MISP and TheHive, two accompaning tools which, just as Elastic, are free to use.</p> <p>Everything will be held virtually.

When done correctly, combining secure defaults and lightweight checks can enable organizations to solve *classes* of vulnerabilities by construction, preventing bug whack-a-mole.</p> <p>In this talk, we\u2019ll present a practical step-by-step methodology for:<br/>Choosing what to focus your AppSec resources on<br/>How to combine secure defaults + lightweight invariant enforcement to eradicate entire vulnerability classes<br/>How to integrate continuous code scanning into your CI/CD processes in a way that\u2019s fast, high signal, and low friction for developers<br/>How to use an open source, lightweight security linting tool to find bugs and anti-patterns specific to your company</p> <p>### Bio###<br/>Clint Gibler (@clintgibler) is the Head of Security Research for r2c, a startup working on giving security tools directly to developers.

Threat modelling is one of the best techniques for improving the security of your software. It is a structured method for identifying weaknesses on design level. However, it is often perceived by the organisations as too expensive to introduce, or too slow to fit modern lifecycles, be it Agile, Lean, or DevOps.</p> <p>This talk will show how to fit threat modelling in fast-paced software development, without requiring every developer to become an expert. The outcomes should be immediately applicable, hopefully empowering you to try it at work tomorrow.</p> <p>About Irene:<br/>Irene Michlin is a security consultant at IBM. Before going into application security consultancy, Irene worked as software engineer, architect, and technical lead at companies ranging from startups to corporate giants. Her professional interests include securing development life-cycles and architectures.</p> <p>20:45 - 21:00<br/>Goodbyes and plans going forward<br/>Thomas Ljungberg Kristensen - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus<br/>Dennis Perto - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus</p> "}, {"chapter": "Switzerland", "repo": "www-chapter-switzerland", "name": "OWASP DefectDojo - the Heart of your AppSec Automation", "date": "2021-04-14", "time": "18:00", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASPSwitzerland/events/276343964/", "timezone": "Europe/Zurich", "description": "<p>OWASP Switzerland brings you another high profile talk directly from the source.</p> <p>Defect Dojo project leads Aaron Weaver and Matt Tesauro as well as contributor/moderator Fred Blaise will initiate us into the magic of Defect Dojo.</p> <p>Abstract<br/>You\u2019re tasked with \u2018doing AppSec\u2019 for your company and you\u2019ve got more apps and issues than you know how to deal with.

In order to successfully respond to Security incidents we needed a centralized platform which aggregates all the data about our premises in a single place.</p> <p>Surface Security (Security Intelligence Automation Platform) is an internally built tool which assists our internal Security teams to gain a holistic view about our externally exposed assets. More than that, it facilitates faster incident response based on the information correlated by it. Surface started as a small project in which we tried to close the gaps identified in our security controls. The platform's core is built in Django which is a Python-based open-source framework which has a fast learning curve. Besides Django, we're using technologies like Ansible (automation), Dkron (fault-tolerant jobs), Elasticsearch (Security metrics storage) and Grafana (reporting). During the whole period it gained a lot of traction in our company determining people to contribute to its success by implementing and suggesting new features. We're currently utilizing it for reporting the Security gaps to other areas of key business areas and for Security controls like: monitoring our externally exposed assets, vulnerability management, security incidents, bug bounty reports and penetration testing.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>I'm focused on Application Security Engineering &amp; Penetration Testing combined with CAMS mindset (Culture, Automation, Measurement, Sharing - DevSecOps) and I reported security bugs to Google, Facebook, Uber, Bitdefender, ING Bank, Yahoo or other companies. One of the most interesting thing is that I built a platform \"Surface - Security Intelligence Automation Platform\" which is being used by more than 900 people in Paddy Power Betfair, Flutter and I was the Security SME for a Private Cloud based on OpenStack with environments as code.</p> <p>&gt;&gt;Abstract - Detect complex code patterns using semantic grep<br/>We\u2019ll discuss a program analysis tool we\u2019re developing called Semgrep. It's a multilingual semantic tool for writing security and correctness queries on source code (for Python, Java, Go, C, and JS) with a simple \u201cgrep-like\u201d interface. The original author, Yoann Padioleau, worked on Semgrep\u2019s predecessor, Coccinelle, for Linux kernel refactoring, and later developed Semgrep while at Facebook. He\u2019s now full time with us at r2c. Semgrep is a free open-source program analysis toolkit that finds bugs using custom analysis we\u2019ve written and OSS code checks. Semgrep is ideal for security researchers, product security engineers, and developers who want to find complex code patterns without extensive knowledge of ASTs or advanced program analysis concepts.<br/>For example, find subprocess calls with shell=True in Python using the query:<br/>subprocess.open(..., shell=True)<br/>This will even find snippets like:<br/>import subprocess as s<br/>s.open(f'rm {args}', shell=True)</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Bence Nagy is a software engineer at r2c, working on Semgrep, an open-source syntax-aware code search tool. At r2c, his responsibilities tend towards building various interfaces atop the core semgrep CLI. These include CI integrations, editor extensions, and the semgrep.dev web app. He previously led a developer experience team at Kiwi.com, the Czech Republic\u2019s top startup at the time of its acquisition in 2019. You should totally ask him for video game recommendations after the talk.</p> "}, {"chapter": "Cork", "repo": "www-chapter-cork", "name": "OWASP Cork - Adversarial machine learning", "date": "2021-03-23", "time": "18:00", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Cork/events/276818788/", "timezone": "Europe/Dublin", "description": "<p>**** Meeting link will be added closer to the date and accessible to those who RSVP only ****</p> <p>Talk 1: Deep malware obfuscation<br/>Speaker: Saeid Rezaei - Machine learning researcher at University College Cork</p> <p>Deep learning has been widely utilized in many practical applications and achieved remarkable commercial success. It can be used in malware obfuscation engines which are used to secure digital rights management against hackers, and bypass anti-malware programs. In the real world scenarios, there are some constraints that should be considered during malware obfuscation. Using deep learning can help to select the best samples which are satisfying these constraints. In this presentation, we will show how can we use deep learning techniques to improve the performance of obfuscator engines against malware detection techniques.</p> <p>Talk 2: Adversarial machine learning (AML)<br/>Speakers: Dr. Sorcha Healy Principal Engineer, Lead Data Scientist at McAfee and Dr. Catherine Huang - Principal Engineer and Senior Staff Data Scientist at McAfee</p> <p>In this talk Sorcha and Catherine will review the general attack landscape against ML and ML security providers. Understanding the fundamentals behind what a machine learning model does and how it works in combination with the Mitre Adversarial Matrix can provide some sensible MLOps practices to protect the components of a ML system.
