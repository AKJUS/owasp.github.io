## Project Leadership x2

Effective immediately, [Jannik Hollenbach](https://infosec.exchange/@jannik) joins [Bjoern Kimminich](https://bsky.app/profile/bkimminich.bsky.social) as co-project lead of the OWASP Juice Shop. Jannik is an active contributor to the project for many years. His achievements include developing the [MultiJuicer](https://github.com/juice-shop/multi-juicer) hosting-platform, building the [Hacking Instructor](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/companion-guide/latest/part1/challenges.html#_hacking_instructor) mechanism for our in-app tutorials, and fully re-creating the Score Board in a modern tile-based layout.

Lacking a second project leader was an open topic of OWASP Juice Shop since a new release of the [Project Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/projects) in 2021. Not only are we now addressing this compliance issue, but an operational continuity issue as well.

## Simplified contributor recognition

With the above leadership and process changes, we are effeectively abandoning the term "Core Team" from our website and repositories. Every contributor should feel like a team member, regardless of their level of involvement. We will continue to publish regular updates of our top contributor diagram based on `git-stats` into our [Hall of Fame](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/blob/master/HALL_OF_FAME.md#github-contributors):

The top-translators in our [CrowdIn project](https://crowdin.com/project/owasp-juice-shop) will also continue to be recognized on the [Hall of Fame](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/blob/master/HALL_OF_FAME.md#translators) of our main repository. 

Repository and GitHub org level admin and maintainer permissions will remain reserved for the project leaders and hand-selected trusted contributors like our former "Core Team" members, top-contributors, and GSoC mentors Timo Pagel & Shubbam Palriwala.
