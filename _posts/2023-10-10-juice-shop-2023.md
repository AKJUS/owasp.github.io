### The brand new Score Board

If you are an early-day Juice Shop user, you might remember that the challenge Score Board was pretty simplistic back in the day. With more and more challenges came the need to categorize and tag them as well as introduce more difficulty levels. This, and a growing number of additional features - from coding challenges to local progress backups - led to an ever more complicated and convoluted Score Board UI and accordingly a decrease in user experience. What increased meanwhile, was the loading time of the Score Board. A bad combination. Instead of fixing the existing Score Board, the team decided to start with a clean slate. The visually and UX-wise stunning result can be seen in the screenshot below:

This was made possible thanks to a professional UI/UX design contract generously funded by the OWASP Foundation. Vibhuti Arora created [an awesome tile-style new layout](https://www.figma.com/file/DwC5ErhRz6gb3eTZEYYriS/Juiceshop-Scoreboard) in multiple fast-feedback iterations with the Juice Shop core team. Already during the design phase, core team member Jannik Hollenbach tirelessly worked on the implementation of the design, which has been available since [OWASP Juice Shop `v15.1.0`](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/releases/tag/v15.1.0) as a preview with the ability to switch between old and new layout.

With the next major release `v16.0.0` the new Score Board will become the default, while still allowing to switch back to the old look & feel - although I do not see any good reasons to do so. The major release `v17.0.0` is then planned for retiring the old Score Board from the application entirely.
