Welcome to the annual More than a Password Day! To celebrate this year's event, OWASP is enabling multi-factor authentication across the OWASP Foundation's infrastructure. This is a significant step forward in securing our systems and data, and we're excited to share this news with you.

## How to enable multi-factor authentication on your account

If you haven't yet enabled multi-factor authentication, just sign in today and follow the prompts. If you already have MFA enabled, you're all set!

## How to run a security check on your OWASP account

We recommend you run a security check on your account to ensure your account is secure.

Simpler to use and far more secure than passwords, passkeys use cryptographic to prove that you are you.

Email is the most common form of resetting your password. Add extra security to deter access to your accounts:

- Strong password (long, randomly generated and unique)
- Multi-factor authentication / two-step verification

![Add layers of security](/pages/events/featured/guidance_part_3.png)

Additional security measures can help prevent phishing and other attacks, if used in addition to your password.

- A hardware security key (or token)
- An authenticator app

![Use a password manager](/pages/events/featured/guidance_part_4.png)

- Using a password manager means you can use strong, randomly generated, harder to guess passwords.
- Use a strong, memorable password manager password.  

![Use a technique or passphrases to pick passwords](/pages/events/featured/guidance_part_5.png)

- Use "three random words" or passphrases to pick passwords that are easier to remember but hard to guess.

Your passwords should be changed immediately if:

- One of your devices is compromised
- If an online site or service you use is hacked

Using random unique passwords with a password manager means you only need to change breached passwords. Many password managers can help you identify which passwords need changing.
