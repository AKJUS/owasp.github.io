### The Need for Low-Code/No-Code Security

Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) development platforms provide a development environment used to create application software through a graphical user interface instead of traditional hand-coded computer programming.
LCNC platforms reduce the amount of traditional hand-coding, enabling accelerated delivery of business applications.

As LCNC platforms proliferate and become widely used by organizations, there is a clear and immediate need to create awareness around security and privacy risks related to applications developed on such platforms.

The primary goal of the [OWASP Low-Code/No-Code Top 10 project](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-low-code-no-code-security-risks/) document is to provide assistance and education for organizations looking to adopt and develop LCNC applications.
The guide provides information about what are the most prominent security risks for such applications, the challenges involved, and how to overcome them.
