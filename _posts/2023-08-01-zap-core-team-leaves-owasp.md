title: ZAP Core Team Leaves OWASP
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

---

Today is a sad day; today the ZAP team is leaving the OWASP Foundation and joining SSP, a new Linux Foundation entity that Mark Curphey told us he would build. The sad part is that I had hoped that Mark was building an additive thing - something that would overall improve the state of software security - but what he’s actually done is create a funding entity that’s commercially driven, to use to pull projects out of OWASP.

It’s not a sad day for ZAP. Nor is it a sad day for Simon and Ricardo. For the Zed Attack Proxy and for the two former OWASP project leads this is a good news day. Simon and Ricardo will be able to work on ZAP full time, paid for by the Linux Foundation and the future ZAP will definitely benefit from the funding the Linux Foundation has access to and the time that the LF is buying for Simon and Ricardo.

It does come at a cost however; what will ZAP look like in a few years? I hope it’ll be fantastic and that Simon and Ricardo will be able to direct the future as they always have, simply with the funding they never did have to move the needle forward faster - but it might not. There is, after all, a cost associated with being given money to build a thing. And that cost is that those giving the money tend to want to direct where that thing goes.

Nevermind the cost to OWASP that the loss of a strategic project will have. And I do think that Simon, Rick and Ricardo are at least a little concerned about that loss. OWASP has been their project’s home for thirteen-odd years, and they are valued and honoured members of our community and I have to believe that they still care about that community.

That brings me to the saddest part of today. The saddest part is that Mark, who started OWASP, but who couldn’t force the community to do things his way while he briefly rejoined the board, has decided to try to dismantle it now. Instead of creating the collaborative entity that could “help fund” OWASP projects as he said he was going to do, he’s instead decided that he’ll poach the projects he likes. This could have been done another way but I believe that Mark has made this choice intentionally.

I’m happy for Simon, and Ricardo. I’m even happy for ZAP - if somewhat dubious as to its future. But I’m sad for this community and I hope that when the ZAP team wants to come home there is still a place for the project.
