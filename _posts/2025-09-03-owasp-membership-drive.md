title: OWASP Elections 2025 - Become a member today!
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

---

OWASP's direction comes from members of our community like you voting for the Global Board of Directors. Your vote is your voice, and it matters! The only way to get a ballot is to be a member on September 30, 2025. Please [join or renew your membership](https://owasp.glueup.com/organization/6727/memberships/) today!

We have a [large field of candidates running for the Board of Directors](https://board.owasp.org/elections/2025_elections), and we need to make sure the community's voice heard loud and clear by having as many OWASP members participate as possible. OWASP financial membership not only gives you a vote but also strengthens our community. Don't miss your chance to make a difference!

## Join before the price rise!

Membership starts from $20 USD for regional or student memberships, and $50 USD for one year memberships. Two year ($35/$95) and Lifetime Memberships ($200/$500) are the best value. Lifetime Membership will be going up to $750 USD soon, so now has never been a better time to become a Lifetime member!

## Global AppSec Discounts

If you want to obtain a ticket to [Global AppSec DC with a one year membership](https://owasp.glueup.com/event/131624/register/), this is even better value! Not only do you immediately get $100 off the admission price, you will also be an OWASP Member who is eligible to vote if you register before September 30, 2025. Scroll down to "General Conference Admission + 1 Year OWASP Membership", select the number of attendees, and register for the event.

Creating memberships via the event registration process is a partially manual process, so please give us a few days to process your membership application after you purchase your Global AppSec DC ticket. All Global AppSec DC tickets with memberships received before September 30, 2025 will be eligible for a ballot at the forthcoming election.

## Joining OWASP as a new member

Joining could not be simpler! Just [click here](https://owasp.glueup.com/organization/6727/memberships/) to get started, select the membership type that you want, and proceed to the payment.

Obtaining your OWASP Gmail account is easy! Once your membership is confirmed, you will receive instructions on how to set up your OWASP Gmail account.

Please note: Complimentary Membership is only open to OWASP Leaders, and is a non-voting membership type. Force Majeure Complimentary Membership is a voting type of membership, but due to high levels of fraud in the past, is only available to renewing members who can provide photo identification of proof of residence at the time of renewing. In both cases, evidence of eligibility is required.

## Renewing your membership

If your membership expired before November 12, 2024, just join again [here](https://owasp.glueup.com/organization/6727/memberships/). If it says that you have a membership already, please either sign in if you know your password, or use the Forgot password function, then apply for a new membership. If your membership expired after November 12, 2024, you should have an email with renewal instructions. Please follow those instructions and renew your membership.

Members who have not renewed for over 12 months are at risk of losing their Gmail and GDrive contents. Renew today to continue to have access to your Gmail and GDrive.
