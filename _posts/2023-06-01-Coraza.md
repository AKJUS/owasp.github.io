Exciting news from the Coraza family! üéâ

Today, we're thrilled to announce the release of OWASP Coraza Web Application Firewall (WAF) version v3.0.0, a groundbreaking update to our beloved security tool. This major release significantly reworks Coraza, making it faster, more developer-friendly, and thoroughly cloud-native.
Key Updates Include:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Boost: We've improved performance up to 100 times through several enhancements. Special mention goes to our new debug logs system based on Zerolog, optimized variable collection types, and the cache transformation logic across the same transaction.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Revamped API: We‚Äôve made our API more user-friendly and straightforward.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Plugin Package: Simplifying the extension of Coraza‚Äôs functionalities, this new feature is a developer's delight!

4Ô∏è‚É£ Full CRS v4 Support: Coraza now fully supports the CRS v4 branch. We‚Äôve also included a CRS testing suite in our CI to ensure regression-free development.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Cross-Platform: Now supporting both Go and TinyGo for WASM builds.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Multiphase Feature: An experimental addition for early data evaluation and blocking.

Coraza continues to be a drop-in alternative to the soon-to-be abandoned Trustwave ModSecurity Engine, providing a secure shield against a wide array of web attacks.
Join us as we mark this exciting milestone in Coraza‚Äôs journey. Check out all the updates at Release v3.0.0, and let's continue to make the digital world safer.

Special thanks to the core team, co-leaders, contributors, and supporting companies.
