title: Two Year OWASP Membership Drive
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

---

OWASP is a global community of volunteers who are passionate about improving the security of software. We are excited to announce a two year membership drive to help us grow our community and increase our impact. From May 25 until the end of June, the price of Two Year Individual Membership has been reduced by 15% for standard and regional membership types. This is a great opportunity to **[join OWASP](https://owasp.org/membership/)** or **[extend your existing membership](https://members.owasp.org/)** at a discounted rate.

<!--more-->

Existing members wishing to extend their current membership, please renew in the [Membership Portal](https://members.owasp.org/) and click the yellow Renew button, or if your membership has expired, please use the [join OWASP form](https://owasp.org/membership/) using the email address you originally used to sign up for OWASP membership to make sure that it counts towards your existing membership record.

Membership includes a $100 USD discount to Global AppSec DC, discounts and offers from our Corporate Supporters, and more, and plus, you're directly supporting our mission.

Memberships are just one of the ways you can support OWASP's mission.

- Donations - recurring or one time - help us immeasurably. [Donate Here!](/donate/?reponame=owasp.github.io)
- Become a Corporate Supporter, with a wide range of benefits depending on the level chosen. [Join Here!](/supporters/)

Our other membership levels are also available, but at their normal price. Thank you for your support, and we look forward to seeing you at a future OWASP event soon!
