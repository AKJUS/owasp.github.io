title: Roadmap to version 5.0 of the OWASP ASVS project
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

---

On behalf of the OWASP ASVS leadership team, we are excited to publicise the objectives and roadmap for the upcoming version 5.0 of the flagship OWASP Application Security Project. We are hoping to be able to release a final version by the end of the year but there is a lot to do and we need **your** help!

Our first milestone is the **end of May** by when we would like to have as much feedback as possible on the current standard so as to start planning how the next version will look.

You may wish to read through [the full objectives and roadmap document](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/wiki/Roadmap-to-version-5.0) (or keep reading this post), review the [current "bleeding edge" version](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/tree/master/5.0/en) of the document, and check out our [guide to contributing](). You are then welcome to [open issues](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=standard-asvs-issue.md&title=).
