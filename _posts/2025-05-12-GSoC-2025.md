title: OWASP x Google Summer of Code 2025 - Enabling 15 opportunities for impact
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

---
Weâ€™re proud to share that **OWASP is once again an official mentoring organization for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025**â€”and this year, weâ€™ve secured **15 contributor slots** across some of the most impactful open-source security projects in the world.

This milestone reinforces OWASPâ€™s ongoing commitment to open-source innovation and highlights the strength of our global community of mentors and contributors, as well as our commitment to *education-by-doing* with the GSoC program.

## ðŸ”§ GSoC 2025: Whatâ€™s on Deck?

Contributors will get hands-on experience improving and expanding some of OWASPâ€™s most vital tools:

- **[Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/)** â€“ A globally-used, intentionally insecure web app for security training.
- **[Nettacker](https://owasp.org/www-project-automated-threats/)** â€“ A fast, automated network scanner built for vulnerability detection.
- **[Offensive Web Testing Framework (OWTF)](https://owasp.org/www-project-owtf/)** â€“ A smart framework for streamlined penetration testing.
- **[Bug Logging Tool (BLT)](https://owasp.org/www-project-blt/)** â€“ A next-gen bug tracker focused on gamification to incentivize bug and security reporting.
- **[Nest](http://nest.owasp.org)** â€“ Core infrastructure to power and enable the OWASP projects and contributors ecosystem.
- **[PyGoat](https://owasp.org/www-project-pygoat/)** â€“ A Python-based sandbox for learning and exposing security flaws in modern stacks.
- **[OpenCRE](https://owasp.org/www-project-opencre/)** â€“ A collaborative cybersecurity knowledge base & reference system.
