title: Resignation of Mark Curphey
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

At 09:30 GMT today Mark Curphey officially announced his resignation from the OWASP Global board of Directors. It didn't come as a surprise to the board, as he announced his desire to resign during the last board meeting he attended last week on Thursday the 16th of March. It also shouldn't have come as a surprise to the OWASP community in general as Mark also [announced it on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/yesterdays-owasp-board-directors-meeting-i-resigned-my-mark-curphey/) on the Friday following that meeting.

That post by Mark does a good job of describing the reasons he has for making this move and there are few folks more disappointed than I am that he's come to the conclusion that he has. I would very much have loved to have channelled Mark's unrivalled energy and his considerable talents towards making OWASP a better place for projects.

But OWASP is first and foremost a community of contributors and participants, from the individual members who elected the board through the amazing folks who build, maintain and improve the [277 projects](https://owasp.org/projects/status/) currently under its banner and it includes all the folks who simply attend meetings at one of the [285 active chapters](https://owasp.org/chapters/status/). It's all the Leaders who get involved and who are wanting OWASP to be the best it can be. It's every one of you that leverages the work those folks put in and because it is all about this community, it must always remain independent. 

I know that the projects are going to be most disappointed by Mark's move - especially those that signed the [open letter](https://github.com/owasp-change/owasp-change.github.io). However, Mark's efforts on your behalf do not end with his resignation: the board and I will continue the efforts we are making to find a way to allow you all to flourish - without us having to change the democratic approach we have to the make-up of the board to achieve that. And we expect you to continue to support our efforts in doing so and to continue pushing us to get things right.

As for Mark's planned future work in the open community: I'm excited to be honest, and I'll follow his progress closely as I hope all of you will. He started this thing that I, we, all love (OWASP) and we are always keen to work with other like-minded organisations like we do with [Open SSF](https://openssf.org/) (where Andrew van der Stock is on the board) and [Nonprofit Cyber](https://nonprofitcyber.org/) (where I currently sit on the board as an OWASP board member). But I do hope that whatever he builds works together with OWASP and not at cross purposes.

As for the board's next steps? Well: to start with we didn't move things forward on Thursday and Friday last week, so we'll have to try to catch up on that time now on the strategy for the Foundation (generally) and projects (and the open letter - more specifically). We also need to fill Mark's seat so expect to see many more public meetings of the board to do all that ASAP.
