# OWASP Partners with InfoSecMap to Strengthen Global InfoSec Collaboration

---

**Weâ€™re stronger together.**

In a move that highlights the power of open collaboration, **OWASP** is proud to announce a new partnership with [**InfoSecMap**](https://infosecmap.com) â€” a community-focused project dedicated to making InfoSec events and resources more **accessible**, **global**, and **inclusive**.

At its core, OWASP is a community-driven force building **free, open resources** for anyone who cares about building safer software. InfoSecMap, meanwhile, has been quietly but impactfully connecting the dots across the global security ecosystem â€” mapping events from major conferences and CTFs to local meetups and community-driven resources â€” all without pay-to-play marketing.

> This partnership is more than symbolic â€” itâ€™s strategic.

## Why It Matters

Together, OWASP and InfoSecMap are working to:

* **Expand access** to global InfoSec events and educational resources
* **Amplify underrepresented voices** and geographies in cybersecurity
* **Improve visibility and knowledge sharing** across borders and disciplines

## What This Means for You

Whether youâ€™re a developer in **Nairobi**, a student in **SÃ£o Paulo**, or a security researcher in **Chicago**, this collaboration gives you better visibility into the global InfoSec landscape â€” and helps you connect with communities, not just corporations.

Youâ€™ll get access to:

* Real-time updates on InfoSec events around the world
* Local and international OWASP chapter activities
* Community-curated resources that reflect a broader, more inclusive view of our industry

This effort is rooted in the belief that **open source should also mean open access** â€” and weâ€™re building the infrastructure to make that a reality.

Letâ€™s build the future of cybersecurity together: one thatâ€™s **open**, **transparent**, and truly **global**.
